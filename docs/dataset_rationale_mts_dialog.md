### Rationale: Why MTS-Dialog is Suitable for This Project

- **Task alignment**: MTS-Dialog pairs doctorâ€“patient dialogues with sectioned clinical notes (e.g., HPI, Assessment). This directly supports training/evaluating abstractive summarization models that distill rich clinical context into concise sections, analogous to the Brief Hospital Course target we aim to produce.

- **Scale appropriate for clinical NLP**: The corpus contains 1,700 synthetic clinical encounters with paired notes, which is comparatively large for dialogue-to-note datasets in healthcare. This size is sufficient to establish baselines, perform ablations, and support robust validation.

- **Pre-processed and ready-to-use**: The dataset ships as structured CSV files with predefined train/validation/test splits and consistent schemas. This reduces data engineering overhead and accelerates pipeline development (ingestion, preprocessing, evaluation) in our MLOps stack.

- **Realistic clinical context without PHI risk**: Although synthetic, the dialogues were authored to mirror real clinical conversations and note structure, enabling models to learn domain language and section conventions while avoiding protected health information. This simplifies compliance and speeds iteration.

- **Accessible and permissive**: Publicly available on GitHub under a Creative Commons license, enabling immediate use without credentialed access workflows.
